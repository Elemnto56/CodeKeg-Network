# Welcome to CodeKeg!
CodeKeg is a developer network built on the idea that everything should be easily accessible. I have always struggled to find tools that I need, because of how scattered they were. So, I chose to build CodeKeg, in order to assist those who suffered my same issues. In addition to sharing tooling, news and blogs, will be shown on CodeKeg. In order to truly make CodeKeg great, I need the help of other devs. So make a PR with your special tools you want to share with the world!
